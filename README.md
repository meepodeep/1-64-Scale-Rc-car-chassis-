# 1/64 Scale RC chassis
Universal chassis for 1/64 scale rc cars, to turn your Hot Wheels into things to annoy other residents of your home.

# why does this exist 
Every week before finals for the last 2 years I have designed another revision of an RC car. This is this semester's version, inspired by a Hot Wheels Datsun 240Z I found at the grocery store is a 1/64 scale car chassis. 

# instructions 
# Reciver
1. Desolder the headers if needed; however, you may not have to, depending on what you are trying to use the chassis for
# Powertrain
1. center your 9g sevo
2. Disassemble the servo and remove the PCB.
3. Solder the double-shafted motor to the pcb.
4. Power on the servo and rotate the potentiometer so the motor stops moving.
5. Measure the resistance between the outer pin and the center on both sides of the potentiometer.
6. Get 2 resistors of that resistance and if not the same, average the two
7. You need to connect one leg from each resistor together and solder the join to the middle of the three points, then solder the remaining two legs to the other points, each to a different one.
# Chassis
1. Resin 3d print all of the parts.
# Assembly
1. Glue in the motor and stick the ESC on top of the motor mount

2. Cut the servo arm to the second hole, and attach and glue in the ball joint to the outer hole
3. Attach the arm to the ball joint on the servo and the linkage, and then screw the linkage into the knuckles with m1 screws

4. Attach the servo and slot the steering assembly into the chassis

5. Secure the steering assembly with the final part and 2 m1 screws

6. Solder everything to the receiver like this

7. Glue the receiver on top of the serv,o making sure there is enough room for the battery to fit underneath

8. Drill out the rear wheels with the size of the drive motor shaft and glue the wheels on with ca
9. Use the original front axle cut in half to stick through the steering linkage, and ca glue on the inside. Make sure not to get glue anywhere near the wheel.
