# why does this exist 
Every week before finals for the last 2 years I have designed another revision of an RC car. This is this semester's version, inspired by a Hot Wheels Datsun 240Z I found at the grocery store is a 1/64 scale car chassis.

2. Cut the servo arm to the second hole, and attach and glue in the ball joint to the outer hole

9. Use the original front axle cut in half to stick through the steering linkage, and ca glue on the inside. Make sure not to get glue anywhere near the wheel.
